most of this code is ripped straight from the Think Tank mod by the Cppkies team. I am working on changing this.

problems:

-the Converter images are running of off files on my computer so until the mod is done and this repository is made public only i can see the images

-The converters in the middle menu (with minigames, building levels, etc) has the factory background as its background but the color schemes don't match
